# Asset Viewer
Program to view game assets with different modes, change textures and light attributes quick and easy.

"Open with program" doesn't work yet.
You need to drop 3D asset on the program and set textures manually.

Planned updates:
- workable "Open with..." option on Windows
- texture palette
- skybox (changeble)
- PBR with IBL
- adding lights
